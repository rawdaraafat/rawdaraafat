# Purpose : Subtract a square. This is a two-player mathematical game of strategy. It is played by two
# people with a pile of coins (or other tokens) between them. The players take turns removing
# coins from the pile wether it is a choice from the player or a random generator number betweem (10, 1000), always removing a
# non-zero square number of coins (1, 4, 9, 16, ...).
# The player who removes the last coin wins.
